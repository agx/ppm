About
-----
prepaid-manager-applet aims to ease the handling of mobile internet connections
using GSM mobile prepaid cards on the GNOME Desktop. Such a SIM card can either
be in a mobile phone used as a modem, a usb 3g module (usb surf stick) or used
by the built in 3G chipset in your laptop/netbook.

* It allows you to check the current balance and to top up the credit.
* It uses ModemManager to talk to your GSM chipset.

Requirements
------------
* ModemManager with ussd support (>= 0.5)
* mobile-broadband-provider-info with top-up support (>= 20110319)
* GTK+ >= 3.0.0, Debian package: libgtk+-3-0
* PyGObject >= 2.28.3, Debian package: python-gobject
* DBus Python Bindings >= 0.83, Debian package: python-dbus

  meson . _build
  ninja -C _build

Running
