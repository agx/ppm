prepaid-manager-applet aims to ease the handling of mobile internet connections
using GSM mobile prepaid cards on the GNOME Desktop. Such a SIM card can either
be in a mobile phone used as a modem, a usb 3g module (usb surf stick) or used
by the built in 3G chipset in your laptop/netbook.

* It allows you to check the current balance and to top up the credit.
* It uses ModemManager to talk to your GSM chipset.

* mobile-broadband-provider-info with top-up support:
    http://git.debian.org/?p=users/agx/mobile-broadband-provider-info.git
