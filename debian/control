Description: Prepaid Manager Applet
 prepaid-manager-applet aims to ease the handling of mobile internet
 connections using GSM mobile prepaid cards on the GNOME Desktop. Such a SIM
 card can either be in a mobile phone used as a modem, a usb 3g module (usb
 surf stick) or used by the built in 3G chipset in your laptop/netbook.
 .
 It currently supports USSD messges and uses ModemManager to talk to your GSM
 chipset.
